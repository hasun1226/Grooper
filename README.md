Grooper is a web application that helps students find groups for courses. It uses a poll-like interface for the users who are looking for groups. When a user creates a poll he or she can give a short description of what they are looking for. To help with the choosing process the creator can add questions to the poll. A group is formed with the applicants that the creator of the poll chooses.

### Requirement list from Phase 1 updated
  The requirement list was updated based on the feedback we received from the TAs.

### Cobalt API
Based on the feedback received from one of the TAs we have decided to use the Cobalt API. The Cobalt API is a tool for accessing public information from University of Toronto. This API will be used to retrieve more information for the different courses.
